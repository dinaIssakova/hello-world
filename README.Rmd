# rgenesconverged

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rgenesconverged is to identify instances of convergent evolution by sequence similarity at the molecular level, by finding conserved, similar, and independently arising sequences within user-submitted phylogenetic trees. It's modeled from concepts introduced in a seminal paper:

Zhang, J. and Kumar, S. (1997) Detection of Convergent and Parallel Evolution at the Amino Acid Sequence Level. Mol. Biol. Evol. 14(5):527-536. 

## Installation

You can install the first-draft version of rgenesconverged from github with:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("dinaIssakova/rgenesconverged")
library(rgenesconverged)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(rgenesconverged)
# We use the example datasets from phangorn, tree and primates (see ./data).

summary(tree)
summary(primates)

getConvergent(tree, primates, "Mouse", 1)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
