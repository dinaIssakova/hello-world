\title{Calculate likelihood of N chance 'convergent' sites}
\usage{
probOfNSitesByChance(tree, spe1, spe2, m, n, p = (1/20))
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylogenetic tree}

\item{spe1}{The name of species 1}

\item{spe2}{The name of species 2}

\item{m}{The length of the genes. (Must of equal length)}

\item{n}{The number of potential convergent sites}

\item{p}{The fraction of the amino acid at the target position in the evaluated genome. (Default is 1/20)}
}
\value{
Scaled likelihood that the amino acids satisfying the conditions of convergent evolution is by chance.
probOfNSitesByChance(tree, "Human", "Chimp", 20, 2)
}
\description{
Calculate the probability that n sites between the two species will satisfy the conditions of convergent evolution by chance.
